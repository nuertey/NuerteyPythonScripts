# asyncio-mqtt combines the stability of the time-proven paho-mqtt 
# library with a modern, asyncio-based interface.
# 
#     No more callbacks! üëç
#     No more return codes (welcome to the MqttError)
#     Graceful disconnection (forget about on_unsubscribe, on_disconnect, etc.)
#     Compatible with async code
#     Fully type-hinted
#     Did we mention no more callbacks?
