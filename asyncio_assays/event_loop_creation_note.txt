In Python's asyncio library, new_event_loop and get_event_loop serve different purposes:
asyncio.new_event_loop():

    Creates a new event loop object. This is useful when you need to:
        Run an event loop in a separate thread.
        Use a custom event loop policy.
        Have multiple event loops in a single application. 

asyncio.get_event_loop():

    Gets the current event loop for the current thread. If no event loop exists, it creates one (depending on the policy and Python version).
    Deprecated in Python 3.10+: Use get_running_loop() within coroutines and callbacks instead.
    Use with caution: In complex scenarios or with custom policies, get_event_loop() can lead to unexpected behavior. 

Recommendation:

    For most cases, use asyncio.run():
    This high-level function handles creating and closing the event loop automatically, making your code cleaner and easier to manage.
    For advanced scenarios:
        Use get_running_loop() within coroutines and callbacks.
        Use new_event_loop() to create separate event loops in specific threads or with custom policies. 

Example:
Python
Execution output

import asyncio

async def main():
    print("Hello from coroutine")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

Hello from coroutine
Key differences:

    Creation:
    new_event_loop creates a new loop, while get_event_loop gets the current one (or creates one if none exists).
    Deprecation:
    get_event_loop is deprecated in favor of get_running_loop in coroutines and callbacks.
    Recommended use:
    asyncio.run is recommended for most cases, while new_event_loop and get_running_loop are for specific scenarios.
