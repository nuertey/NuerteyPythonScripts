# Meanwhile I tried to find out why your Plotly figure was different from that drawn with networkx. I noticed that you labeled the nodes in the Excel file starting with 1, but Plotly code supposed that nodes are labeled from 0. So there was a nonconcordance between node labels and edge end labels. Moreover, Iâ€™m wondering why you defined a networkx graph as long as your Excel file contained all information to draw a Plotly network.
# 
# Only when you cannot provide the node positions you have to define first a networkx graph and set a graph layout to place the nodes in the plane, i.e. to assign them a position (expressed by node coordinates).
# 
# Here is a new code that resulted by modifying data from your Excel file to get the right Plotly network and avoiding the use of networkx. Moreover I assigned the node indices as labels:
