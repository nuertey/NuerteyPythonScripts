Price Prediction in the Sharing Economy A Case Study with Airbnb.pdf

"Looking at two U.S. cities with developed Airbnb markets, this study aims to use linear
regression analysis to determine the significance that variables inside of the host’s control have
on price versus variables outside of the host’s ability to control. The results show that variables
within the host’s control appear to have more of an impact on price versus variables outside of
the host’s control. Also, when variables inside and outside of the host’s control are combined,
they prove most accurate when predicting the price of a listing."

...

For this study, host-controlled variables will be defined as any
features of the listing provided by the host and the details of the host. Prior research has
associated these factors as potential drivers of price (Chen and Xie, 2017; Gibbs et al., 2017).
Listing attributes considered include the type of accommodation, number of rooms, listing size,
listing location, view from listing, and listing facilities. The host attributes considered include
level of professionalism, years of experience, degree of trustworthiness, and the host’s
responsiveness. (Ert et al., 2016; Li et al., 2015; Wu, 2016).

...

One study also determined the importance of location through comparisons between a
general linear model (GLM) and a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, with the
GWR model proving to be more accurate with a higher adjusted R-squared. (Zhang et al. 2017).
Social factors, such as listing review score, host responsiveness, and total number of reviews,
were shown to have a correlation with consumers spending more money on an Airbnb listing
(Tang & Sangani 2015). It has also been shown that factors relating to listing size, property
characteristics, amenities, services, rental rules, and customer reviews significantly affect listing
prices (Dogru & Pekin 2017).

2.4 Superhost Status
One of the most important host attributes: “Superhost status” is defined by Airbnb as “hosts who
provide a shining example for other hosts, and extraordinary experiences for their guests.”3 A
host must meet a certain criterion set by Airbnb to receive the “Superhost” badge.4 Based on
previous studies, hosts with a “Superhost” badge typically post their listings at higher prices
when they receive more reviews and higher ratings. (Liang et al. 2017). High quality host photos,
“Superhost” Status, ratings, and reviews were confirmed to have a significant contribution to
listing prices (Liang et al., 2017).

"Whatever your financial goals, a savvy pricing strategy is key to success. But reaching your earning goals can be a bit of a balancing act, with variables changing day to day and week to week. Here are some helpful insights, along with a few tools and tips to simplify the process.

Think like a guest

Price is one of the main factors guests consider when choosing where to stay. No matter how beautiful your space, if it’s priced higher than comparable listings in the area, there’s a good chance you’ll miss out on bookings.

Do a little market research

Start by searching Airbnb for similar spaces in your area, taking into consideration:

    Your property type (private room, entire home, etc.)
    The number of beds/bedrooms you provide
    The number of guests you can accommodate 
    Your available amenities

Make sure to check multiple dates in the future. Listings with competitive pricing tend to book up first, so don’t make the mistake of benchmarking against properties still available just a week or two away—those are likely to be the ones that weren’t booked because they were priced too high. Thinking ahead will also help you learn how hosts near you adjust pricing seasonally, on weekends, and for special events or holidays.

- Consider your location and amenities

Remember that things you’re factoring into your pricing may not be obvious to guests. For instance, the safety and beauty of your neighborhood may mean nothing to someone who doesn’t know your town, so be sure to call them out in your listing. Aspects of your great hospitality like breakfast or a welcome basket full of treats might also help you warrant a higher price, but you’ll need to make them super clear in your listing and photos.

Stand out with great pricing

“When you’re just starting out, it’s a good idea to have a competitive price,” says host Ros from Durban, South Africa. Guests are hesitant to book listings with no reviews, so for new hosts, setting your price a little lower than your ideal number is a great way to attract guests. Once you have a few positive reviews under your belt, you can raise your price to match the demand in your area. Competitive pricing can also help your listing rank higher in search.

Use the Smart Pricing tool

Want to take away some of the guesswork? Turn on Smart Pricing. Airbnb’s pricing tool takes into account over 70 different factors—plus controls you’ve set—to determine the best price for each available night on your calendar. Your pricing will automatically update depending on things like:

    Lead time: As a check-in date approaches

    Local popularity: The number of people searching for home stays in your area

    Seasonality: Predictable seasonal changes in demand for home stays in your area

    Listing popularity: How many views and bookings your listing receives 

    Review history: Your amount of positive reviews from successful stays
