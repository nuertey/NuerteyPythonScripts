Attached is a graph showing the results of some programming fun that I did today to analyze all the Lyft, Uber and other ridesharing rides taken in Chicago. I obtained the raw data from the City of Chicago and then massaged, manipulated and analyzed it myself. Then I plotted it. Some interesting trends obvious from the graph:

1) Majority of the rides tend to be 15 miles or less, however the O'Hare community area has the highest incidence of hailed long rides (i.e. approximately 35 miles or more).

2) Most rides were hailed from the Near North Side community area, followed by the Near West Side community area and followed by the Loop community area.

3) Most riders did not tip at all (tip = $0 on the hover panel on the graph) but the few riders that did, tipped about $30.

Check out the graph attached for more interesting trends. Enjoy. I basically set this project goal for myself today because I wanted to test my data science manipulation techniques with Python on a live dataset (so millions of entries).
