Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa) released:
=======================================
The 20.04 long-term support (LTS) release of Ubuntu, code named "Focal Fossa", is out. There are desktop and server editions, as well as all of the different Ubuntu flavors: Ubuntu Budgie, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu Kylin, Ubuntu MATE, Ubuntu Studio, and Xubuntu. "The Ubuntu kernel has been updated to the 5.4 based Linux kernel, with additional support for Wireguard VPN, AUFS5, and improved support for IBM, Intel, Raspberry Pi and AMD hardware. [...] 20.04 LTS also brings support for installing an Ubuntu desktop system on top of ZFS. The latest version brings performance enhancements and optional encryption support. Zsys, Ubuntu’s ZFS system tool, provides automated system and user state saving. Tight integration with GRUB allows a user to revert to any system state on boot and go back in time to pave the way to a bulletproof Ubuntu Desktop." More information can be found in the release notes.

# Lets query the system first to see its capabilities and whether it fits
# what you ordered. That is, always know thy system. These commands will
# be saved in your history so that you can always refer to them and use
# them if you have to debug some other system:

Use the GNOME Dash to pull up a terminal. We will stick it permanently to the Taskbar/Launcher after this so that next time getting a terminal is just a click. Type Terminal.

Right-click on the Terminal and choose Lock to Launcher. It will now always be there. If there is a terminal open, there will be a dash to the left hand side of it, as many dashes as terminals. Otherwise no dashes.

In the terminal window, type:

whoami
groups

# In Linux program permissions are allowed or disallowed not just by user for that would mean all potential users that could use the laptop would have to be in the system and this would be an inefficient design, but by the groups that they belong to. Essentially everyone in the family for example can create their own account on the laptop and have their own programs and settings and homepage, passwords etc, and none will see each others work or step over each other. You see the thoughtfulness in the design of Linux?

#Install and Setup Python3.7 and virtual env

# Even though Wayo's laptop comes with Python 3.8, install Python 3.7 
# and setup virtual environment for it as my scripts were written for 3.7.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52816156/how-to-create-virtual-environment-for-python-3-7-0

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libpq-dev libssl-dev openssl libffi-dev zlib1g-dev
sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev python3.7

# system-wide install and upgrade all packages
sudo pip3.7 install -U virtualenv 
python3.7 -m virtualenv MyEnv37

# Always source this on first rebooting the computer before running any
# python scripts. That is, always work in the python 3.7 environment so
# that you are guaranteed the version of python that you are using coincides
# with what my scripts are expecting:
source MyEnv37/bin/activate

# The bash prompt should change like the below to indicate that the virtual
# environment is indeed successfully activated, and we are within it:
(MyEnv37) rena@PurpleOS:$ 

pip install --upgrade pip

# Verification step:
python --version
pip --version
virtualenv --version

# show packages installed within the virtual environment
pip list

------------------------------------
# Instead of all the below, perhaps do just these instead:

cd ~/Workspace
git clone https://github.com/nuertey/NuerteyPythonScripts.git
cd NuerteyPythonScripts

# This is another shortcut that I should teach you. This shortcut is basically 
# installing all the packages needed way way below form a list that I had
# automatically generated using pip to query all my python scripts to see
# what other packages they need to successfully run. I generated that list,
# requirements.txt from this other pip command in the directory of my scripts:
#
# pip freeze
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Let's get back to the parent workspace:
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps
cd dash-sample-apps
geany README.md

# To see one of the dash sample apps listed in the above README in action:

# The app concerns automatically generating webpages and graphs to visualize
# clinic patient volume by time of the day, waiting time and care score.
# Yeah, we dont write web pages anymore in the future :). We automatically
# generate them from python dash.
cd apps/dash-clinical-analytics
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

# For hardcore higher level python learning, let's do Neural Networks and
# Deep Machine Learning:
# Install the TensorFlow pip package and others:

pip install anaconda libpython theano amadeus
pip install --upgrade tensorflow

# Try it out to verify if install ws successful:
python -c "import tensorflow as tf;print(tf.reduce_sum(tf.random.normal([1000, 1000])))"

# There are two tensor flow python scripts in NuerteyPythonScripts folder.
# When and if ready for machine learning, run them as follows and peruse what they do.

python tensorflow_experts_example.py

Neural Networks and Deep Learning
by Michael Nielsen

# This step is important so we do not clone a repo into another repo. Hence why it was important that we create a top-level Workspace directory to house your work in the beginning:
cd ~/Workspace
git clone https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning
git clone https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython35

Download the free Neural Networks PDF above and github python source code (git clone it) above. Read the PDF leisurely as you have time (thisis way high level so take your time with the basic stuff first) and try the code samples. It will take your python skills to a higher level. The python scripts concern trying to use Neural Networks and Deep Machine Learning to train a model to automatically recognize and classify peoples' handwritings no matter how squiggly.

And in those code samples on github, we simply train the algorithm and model with handwriting samples taken from thousands and thousands of American high school students and stored in a national database, MNIST. The model then "learns" to begin recognizing handwritings, including squiggly ones...

Here is an excerpt from the beginning of the free PDF:

"Neural networks are one of the most beautiful programming paradigms ever invented. In
the conventional approach to programming, we tell the computer what to do, breaking big
problems up into many small, precisely defined tasks that the computer can easily perform.
By contrast, in a neural network we don’t tell the computer how to solve our problem. Instead,
it learns from observational data, figuring out its own solution to the problem at hand.
Automatically learning from data sounds promising. However, until 2006 we didn’t
know how to train neural networks to surpass more traditional approaches, except for
a few specialized problems. What changed in 2006 was the discovery of techniques for
learning in so-called deep neural networks. These techniques are now known as deep
learning. They’ve been developed further, and today deep neural networks and deep learning
achieve outstanding performance on many important problems in computer vision, speech
recognition, and natural language processing. They’re being deployed on a large scale by
companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Facebook."

# If the above instructions work, then probably do not need the below 
# installs anymore. You can now run any of my python scripts and view
# the output, graphs and automatically launched webpages with javascript
# maps, etc.
