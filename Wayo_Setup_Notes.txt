Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa) released
The 20.04 long-term support (LTS) release of Ubuntu, code named "Focal Fossa", is out. There are desktop and server editions, as well as all of the different Ubuntu flavors: Ubuntu Budgie, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu Kylin, Ubuntu MATE, Ubuntu Studio, and Xubuntu. "The Ubuntu kernel has been updated to the 5.4 based Linux kernel, with additional support for Wireguard VPN, AUFS5, and improved support for IBM, Intel, Raspberry Pi and AMD hardware. [...] 20.04 LTS also brings support for installing an Ubuntu desktop system on top of ZFS. The latest version brings performance enhancements and optional encryption support. Zsys, Ubuntuâ€™s ZFS system tool, provides automated system and user state saving. Tight integration with GRUB allows a user to revert to any system state on boot and go back in time to pave the way to a bulletproof Ubuntu Desktop." More information can be found in the release notes.

Lets query the system first to see its capabilities and whether it fits what you ordered. That is, always know thy system. These commands will be saved in your history so that you can always refer to them and use them if you have to debug some other system:

Use the GNOME Dash to pull up a terminal. We will stick it permanently to the Taskbar/Launcher after this so that next time getting a terminal is just a click. Type Terminal.

Right-click on the Terminal and choose Lock to Launcher. It will now always be there. If there is a terminal open, there will be a dash to the left hand side of it, as many dashes as terminals. Otherwise no dashes.

In the terminal window, type:

whoami
groups

# In Linux program permissions are allowed or disallowed not just by user for that would mean all potential users that could use the laptop would have to be in the system and this would be an inefficient design, but by the groups that they belong to. Essentially everyone in the family for example can create their own account on the laptop and have their own programs and settings and homepage, passwords etc, and none will see each others work or step over each other. You see the thoughtfulness in the design of Linux?
 
man groups

uname -a

# Disk partitions and find out how much disk space do I have on each:

Browser Plugins:
uBlock Origin
Adblock Plus
Fireshot Capture Page
Link Gopher

FireFox Browser Config -> Open Menu -> Preferences -> 
 - Restore previous session
  - Warn you when quitting the browser
 - Tabs (all 3 checked)

 Home
  - Homepage & Tabs; change to Blank Page; you dont want these popup info things to disturb your concentration when you are in the zone. That is another bad thing that Windows does. There is always some popup or ding sound to startle your mind and affect how your mind itself absorbs information efficiently. We want to get you in the zone and working perfectly!

 Privacy & Security -> Logins and Passwords
  - Ask to save logins and passwords for websites

Restart browser now so that all the plugins can better take effect.
